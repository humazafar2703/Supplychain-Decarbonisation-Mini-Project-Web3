# Supplychain-Decarbonisation-Mini-Project-Web3

To use this setup:

Save the contract code in a file named SupplyChain.sol within a contracts directory in your Hardhat project root.

Ensure your hardhat.config.js file is configured as above.

Save the test code in a file named SupplyChainTest.js within a test directory in your Hardhat project root.

You can then run your tests using npx hardhat test. 

Make sure you've installed the required dependencies (@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle, ethereum-waffle, chai, and ethers) via npm.
